Water hardness is classified by its mineral deposits, mainly calcium and magnesium. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), hard water has no known adverse health effect and in turn could be a supplement to calcium and magnesium intake. If the hardness rises to a very noticeable level, this will reflect in the solids feature of the dataset. An additional feature that may be useful is the colour of the water/liquid. This may be a very clear indication of potability at first glance assuming that food colouring has not been added to the water in question.

They also allow us to spot any signs of overfitting and skew towards either of the two possible predictions.<br><br>\n","We can see that, in terms of precision for non-potable water (precision_0), the Multi-Layer Perceptron with added hidden layers (model 10) vastly outperformed the other models. The minimum, maximum, and mean values are all greater than the other nine models. The standard deviation is however noticeably wide and the third highest among the group. Although this spread is large, the high minimum value means that it will still outperform the other models for non-potable precision based on our configurations. The worst model for non_potable precision on average is the Logistic Regression with the liblinear solver and L2 penalty (model 5).<br>\n","For the precision of potable water (precision_1), the Multi-Layer Perceptron with default configurations (model 7) obtained the best results. Taking these results into account, it seems that the Multi-Layer Perceptron is the best type of model when it comes to optimizing for higher precision. However, the 8th and 9th models from the Multi-Layer Perceptron have a zero precision value. This is due to its true positive (tp) count being zero, meaning these two models never correctly predicted the water being potable. It can also be observed that the water has never been predicted to be potable when for these two Multi-Layer Perceptron models. This could be due to incorrect model training or the data itself not focusing enough on potable water as opposed to non-potable water.<br>\n","In terms of recall, the Multi-Layer Perceptron models 7 and 8 have perfect scores for potable water (recall_0). This is caused by our fp value being 0 for these models. Assuming this is incorrect, the next best model would be the Logistic Regression with liblinear solver and L1 penalty (model 6). It seems changing from L2 to L1 penalty reduced the precision, yet increased the recall.<br>\n","Finally, the non-potable water recall (recall_1) has the Multi-Layer Perceptron with added hidden layers (model 10) as the dominant model. All other models seem to struggle to obtain a recall_1 value greater than 0.5 judging by their maximum values. Furthermore, a few of the other models have a 0 recall for this category which indicates no true positives (tp) present. This is validated by comparing with the corresponding precision which also has a value of 0.<br><br>\n","After comparing the precision and recall values of the various models and their configurations, it is evident that the Multi-Layer Perceptron with added hidden layers (model 10) provides the best overall results for predicting the potability of water."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"iqd1oqITPyvW"},"source":["#### b.

true positive (tp) values obtained above allow us to derive the precision and recall values discussed in part a of this section.<br><br>\n","Since around 60% of samples in our data set have the output being non-potable, the training data is skewed towards guessing that the water is non-potable. This is evident by viewing the sums of fp and tp which represent the models predicting potable. Their sums are noticeably lower than their tn and fn counterparts which predict that the water is non-potable. The vast majority of the predictions are of non-potable of tn and fn which then leans more in the direction of tn. This means that our models, on average, are most likely to assume non-potable and be correct with non-potable. Although a substantial amount of predictions of non-potable end up being potable, as shown in fn, this is a much safer prediction than having the reverse where the models would predict that the water is safe to consume and it is not. We can also notice that the fp and tp values for Logistic Regression and a few Multi-Level Perceptron are extremely low with some even reaching 0. This shows that the model were very hesitant at predicting that the water is potable.<br><br>\n","In summary, the models with a more even spread of metrics outperformed the varied and skewed models by a large margin. Although the true positive values are still low in models 1-3, 7, and 10, the true negatives make up for it especially since this is a binary output. Using our configurations, the Naïve Bayes is the most balanced model, the Logistic Regression is consistently low performing, and the Multi-Layer Perceptron is on both ends of the extreme with its custom hidden layers being the best performing model out of all."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"4hD_RyLoHS1y"},"source":["## References"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"Vv6eFsu7HS1y"},"source":["- https://www.kaggle.com/code/hossamgalal68/water-quality-prediction-with-ann-dl-eda/notebook\n","\n","- https://www2.cambridgema.gov/CityOfCambridge_Content/documents/Drinking%20WaterMy%20edition.pdf\n","\n","- https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3775162/\n","\n","- https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.KBinsDiscretizer.html\n","\n","- https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.StandardScaler.html\n","\n","- https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.naive_bayes.CategoricalNB.html\n","\n","- https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.KFold.html\n","\n","- https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.classification_report.html\n","\n","- https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.confusion_matrix.html\n","\n","- https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression.html\n","\n","- https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.neural_network.MLPClassifier.html"]}],"metadata":{"accelerator":"TPU","colab":{"collapsed_sections":["uhrD4aQeHS1n","SmLEhKkJHS1o","LU-LAhIBHS1r","dxw7IEcjHS1r","fPGMRUbgHS1r","6AkfIMBVHS1s","BP_HpqhrHS1s","WC9LtnebHS1t","4CQeYhbCHS1t","TdV9hSIyHS1u","dayp5aI7HS1v","YD4HtXj0HS1v","8q53FvanHS1x","cv6YwCk2HS1x","ONaUxuQiHS1x"],"provenance":[]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3.10.8 64-bit","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.10.8"},"vscode":{"interpreter":{"hash":"949777d72b0d2535278d3dc13498b2535136f6dfe0678499012e853ee9abcab1"}}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
